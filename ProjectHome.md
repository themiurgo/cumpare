Cumpare is a Python-based deduplication commandline tool and library. It aims to simplicity, extensibility and ease of use.

The project's name comes from a variation of the English word "compare", which is the basic action for finding duplicates. The variation itself, "cumpare", is a Sicilian word meaning "best friend". In syntesis, cumpare wants to be the good fella who finds dupes.
